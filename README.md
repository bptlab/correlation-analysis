# Deriving Decisive Case Characteristics in Process Performance Analysis

As described in the thesis, the implementation is split into two parts:

- [Log transformation](log-transformer/README.md)
- [Correlation analysis](correlation-analysis/README.md)

Details can be found in the corresponding `README` files.

Both applications are implemented using Java 11.
